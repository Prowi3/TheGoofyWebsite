    <section class="About">
        <h1>What is Cassia ?</h1>
        <p>Cassia is an app that enables you to run PC games and programs on your Android device</p>

        <h2>When will Cassia be released?</h2>
        <p>We're currently planning to release the first version sometime in 2024 but due to the nature of software development, it might get delayed. Rest assured, we're trying our best to deliver a good product</p>

        <h2>Which input methods will Cassia support?</h2>
        <p>Cassia will support both controllers and on-screen touch controls.</p>

        <h2>Will Cassia support this [mod/program]?</h2>
        <p>Cassia will have a similar amount of compatibility to Wine, as a general rule, if something works on regular Wine then it'll work on Cassia with a couple of exceptions.</p>

        <h2>Will Cassia support game launchers such as Steam?</h2>
        <p>We want to support as many game launchers as possible but we have to work around certain issues to do so performantly such as the usage of CEF in Steam which won't perform as well under FEX. Nonetheless, Steam will be a #1 priority and we'll work on other launchers as we see fit. </p>

        <h2>Who's working on Cassia?</h2>
        <p>The only two developers are @â—± Mark ork being spðŸŒˆ and @ByLaws, with various parts of the wlit between us.</p>

        <h2>Will Cassia run [insert random game]?</h2>
        <p>We generally don't know for sure unless we've tried, the first check should be to see if it works correctly on Proton (via ProtonDB or similar sites). If it does then adjust for how intensive it'll be on mobile HW, modern PC GPUs can use hundreds of watts of power while a mobile GPU only has a maximum of 5-10W</p>
